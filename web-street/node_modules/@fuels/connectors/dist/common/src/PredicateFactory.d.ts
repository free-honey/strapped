/**
 * Since the predicate resources were fetched and added to the TransactionRequest before the predicate

 * resulting in a witness placeholder being added to the witnesses of the TransactionRequest to
 * later be replaced with an actual signature. Since predicate resources do not require a signature,
 * this placeholder witness will be removed when calling `Predicate.populateTransactionPredicateData`.
 * However, we need to validate if this placeholder witness was added here in order to instantiate the
 * predicate with the correct witness index argument.
