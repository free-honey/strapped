To test out the game with a (still very hacky, vibe-coded) TUI, run:
```
cargo run
```

From the base directory.

Many values in the Sway contract are currently hard-coded to enable simpler testing, but those will be improved over time. 

To get the best experience, place bets on Six and Eight only.

Use `/` to modify the VRF number. 
`0` -> `Two`
`10` -> `Six`
`25` -> `Eight`
and to end the current game:
`19` -> `Seven`
